## 🔄 How It Works
This project involves launching a Linux-based EC2 instance on AWS and hosting a static HTML/CSS website using Apache. The EC2 instance acts as a remote server that can serve web content globally over the internet. After configuring the security group and web server, the site becomes publicly accessible through the instance's public IP address.
