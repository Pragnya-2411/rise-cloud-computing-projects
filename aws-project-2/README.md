## 🔄 How It Works
A static website was hosted using an AWS S3 bucket configured for static website hosting. The website files were uploaded and made publicly accessible. CloudFront was added as a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to distribute the site globally with improved performance and security. This setup eliminated the need for servers while ensuring high availability.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to configure and host websites using S3 buckets
- Writing and applying bucket policies for public access
- How CloudFront distributions cache and serve static assets
- Understanding website endpoints vs. S3 URLs
- Deploying cost-efficient and serverless websites on AWS
