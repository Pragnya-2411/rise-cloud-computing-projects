## 🔄 How It Works
- The user enters a city name and clicks "Get Weather".
- The app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Weather details are shown by flipping the card to the back.
- The "Back" button flips the card again for another search.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Consuming a public REST API using JavaScript
- DOM manipulation
- CSS 3D card flipping
- Real-world weather data integration
